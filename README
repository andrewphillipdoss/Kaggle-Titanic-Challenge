This is my attempt at the Titanic: Machine Learning From Disaster challenge on Kaggle.com
link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
My purpose was to familiarize myself with data science and popular Python libraires for plotting, data manipulation,
and machine learning.

You can access my submissions here:

Method:
Used Binary Classification with sklearn's Support Vector Classifier. 
Estimated Age for NaN values using the Title in the passenger's name. Broke Age into Age groups.  
Created a binary isAlone Feature based off of Parch and SibSp. Features were: AgeBand, Sex, PClass, and isAlone. 

So far, my best score is a 76.55%

Next steps:
Experiment with more in-depth feature engineering, classifier selection and tuning, and Ensembling to achieve a higher score.
